# DMA_MPU6050
A whole MPU6050 Lib with stmf1 mcu by hardware dma i2c
This project can be opened by KEIL5
The driver code is created by stm32cubeMX

    I2C1 GPIO Configuration :   
    PB6     ------> I2C1_SCL
    PB7     ------> I2C1_SDA 

MPU6050 raw is read in TIM4 global interupt, it can be found in stm32f1xx_it.c
The raw is saved in struct acc and gyro ,you can transfer it with usart1 or watch them in debug watch window
